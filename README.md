### Project Overview

This project showcases an interactive E-commerce Sales Dashboard built with Microsoft Excel. It visualizes key sales metrics such as revenue, profit, units sold, and country-wise performance. The dashboard helps users gain insights into sales trends and business performance. Created as part of my Excel learning journey.

## Data Source

The dataset used in this project was self-generated for learning purposes. It simulates sales data across different countries and products.

## Tools
- Micosoft Excel - Data cleaning [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
- MYSQL Workbench - Data analysis
- Microsoft power BI - Data visualization

### Data cleaning/Preparation
1. Data cleaning and preparation involved checking for missing values
2. correcting inconsistencies, and ensuring all figures (revenue, cost, profit) were accurately calculated
3. Dates were also standardized for proper time-based analysis.

### Exploratory data analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was performed using pivot tables and charts to identify sales trends, top-performing products, and country-wise performance. Key metrics like total revenue, profit, and units sold were analyzed for insights.

### Data Analysis
1. **Total Sales Analysis** – Calculated overall revenue, cost, and profit.
2. **Product Performance** – Identified best-selling and most profitable products.
3. **Country-wise Analysis** – Compared sales performance across different countries.
4. **Time-based Trends** – Analyzed monthly sales trends using date fields.
5. **Profit Margin Analysis** – Calculated and compared profit margins for products.

### Results and findings
1. The highest revenue came from Product A, mainly sold in the USA.
2. Country X had the most units sold but lower profit margins.
3. Sales peaked in December, indicating strong holiday season performance.
4. Product C had the lowest cost-to-profit ratio, making it the most efficient product.
5. Overall profit margins improved steadily over the analyzed period.

### Recommendations
1. Focus marketing efforts on high-performing products like Product A and C.
2. Improve pricing or reduce costs in low-margin regions like Country X.
3. Prepare inventory and promotions in advance for peak sales months like December.
4. Investigate underperforming products for possible improvement or discontinuation.

### Limitations
1. The dataset is simulated and may not reflect real-world complexities.
2. Limited data points may reduce the accuracy of trend predictions.
3. External factors like market shifts or customer behavior were not considered.
4. Analysis was constrained to Excel, without advanced statistical tools.
